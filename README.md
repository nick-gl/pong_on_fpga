# pong_on_fpga
My Pong attempt didn’t fully work, but it correctly implemented the game physics and collision system, and could send information out through the UART and serial port. I wasn’t able to get Python to read the serial output, so I tested it using PuTTY and I did get to read all the info. Next project will include an LCD instead.
